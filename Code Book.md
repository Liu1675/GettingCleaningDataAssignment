## CODE BOOK - AverageData
***
This code book provides detailed descriptions of each column name in the output data set named "AverageData.csv". This data set summarises the average values of each measurement for each subject who carried out each of the six activities in UCI's Human Activity Recognition experiment.  

### Identifiers  
* `subject` : An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment  
* `activity`: Six activities performed (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) by wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.  

### Measurements
1. `FreqBodyAcc`: body acceleration signal in frequency domain  
2. `FreqBodyAccJerk`: body acceleration Jerk signal in frequency domain  
3. `FreqBodyAccMag`: magnitude of body acceleration signal in frequency domain  
4. `FreqBodyBodyAccJerkMag`: magnitude of body acceleration Jerk signal in frequency domain  
5. `FreqBodyBodyGyroJerkMag`: magnitude of body angular velocity Jerk signal in frequency domain  
6. `FreqBodyBodyGyroMag`: magnitude of body angular velocity in frequency domain  
7. `FreqBodyGyro`: body angular velocity in frequency domain  
8. `TimeBodyAcc`: body acceleration signal in time domain  
9. `TimeBodyAccJerk`: body acceleration Jerk signal in time domain  
10. `TimeBodyAccJerkMag`: magnitude of body acceleration Jerk signal in time domain  
11. `TimeBodyAccMag`: magnitude of body acceleration signal in time domain  
12. `TimeBodyGyro`: body angular velocity in time domain  
13. `TimeBodyGyroJerk`: body angular velocity Jerk signal in time domain  
14. `TimeBodyGyroJerkMag`: magnitude of body angular velocity Jerk signal in time domain  
15. `TimeBodyGyroMag`: magnitude of body angular velocity in time domain  
16. `TimeGravityAcc`: gravity acceleration signal in time domain
